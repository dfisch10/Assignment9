Assignment 9 - Rock, Paper, Scissors Application

In this assignment we were tasked with a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, with one player being the computer who chooses one of the three choices at random simultaneously with the player.Additionally, there are a number of other things this application requires, such as:

1) A leader board of users that contains the top 5 all-time winning record(usernaem & wins/losses), based on their win percentage. Once the scores are displayed it should return, or allow the player to return to the main menu.
2) User will be prompted at start of game to create a new entry, or load as an existing player (with that player information/scores being pulled from a file/database)
3) After logging in as "new user" or "existing user", the game will transition to the next menu, with the appropriate welcome message depending on if they are new or returning. (I.E. "Welcome back 'player'. " or "Welcome 'player'.")
4) The player will also be able to see a list of all scores of existing users, and have the option to delete/erase all user data from the database/file

Once the player is logged in as either a new or an existing user, they will be prompted with a new menu showing the various game modes available for them to play, these are:

1) Sudden Death (first rock, paper, scissors win, wins the match)
2) Triple Threat (best out of 3 rock, paper, scissors games wins the match)
3) Drive For Five (best out of 5 rock, paper, scissors games wins the match)
4) The Ten Tour (best out of 10 rock, paper, scissors games wins the match)

Finally, when the user chooses to "exit application", it will display the wins/losses for that session (you can also add an option to see current scores of ongoing game mode matches for the current session), and it will add/update the new current session scores to your existing player scores in the database. Once the stats are displayed, any key press will cose the window/application. 

## Bonus Points

1) Create a computer assisted AI (based on user pattern and trends) - 100pts
2) Create animation when playing (UI), or improve other areas of the application - 50 pts
3) Additional additive/enhancements to make the game experience better - 50pts
